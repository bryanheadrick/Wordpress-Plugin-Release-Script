# .buildignore - Custom Build Exclusions
#
# This file allows you to specify additional files and folders to exclude
# from your plugin release builds. It works similarly to .gitignore.
#
# Place this file in your plugin's root directory and rename it to .buildignore
#
# Usage:
#   - One pattern per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Patterns support wildcards (*, ?, etc.)
#   - Trailing slashes indicate directories
#
# Examples:

# Exclude specific files
# secret-config.php
# internal-notes.txt

# Exclude directories
# src/
# design-files/
# documentation/

# Exclude by pattern
# *.bak
# *.tmp
# *-dev.php

# Exclude development or source files
# assets/scss/
# assets/src/
# scripts/

# Exclude build artifacts from other tools
# dist/uncompiled/
# cache/

# Notes:
# - These exclusions are IN ADDITION to the default exclusions
# - The .buildignore file itself is automatically excluded
# - Default exclusions include: .git, node_modules, vendor, tests, etc.
