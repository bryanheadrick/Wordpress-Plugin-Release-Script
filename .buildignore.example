# .buildignore - Custom Build Exclusions and Inclusions
#
# This file allows you to specify additional files and folders to exclude
# from your plugin release builds, or to include files that would otherwise
# be excluded by default. It works similarly to .gitignore.
#
# Place this file in your plugin's root directory and rename it to .buildignore
#
# Usage:
#   - One pattern per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Patterns support wildcards (*, ?, etc.)
#   - Trailing slashes indicate directories
#   - Patterns starting with ! are INCLUSIONS (negations) - they override exclusions
#
# Examples:

# Exclude specific files
# secret-config.php
# internal-notes.txt

# Exclude directories
# src/
# design-files/
# documentation/

# Exclude by pattern
# *.bak
# *.tmp
# *-dev.php

# Exclude development or source files
# assets/scss/
# assets/src/
# scripts/

# Exclude build artifacts from other tools
# dist/uncompiled/
# cache/

# ============================================
# NEGATION PATTERNS (Inclusions)
# ============================================
# Use ! prefix to INCLUDE files that are excluded by default
# This is useful when you need to keep specific files from excluded directories

# Example: Include a specific vendor library (vendor/ is excluded by default)
# !vendor/
# !vendor/my-essential-library/
# !vendor/my-essential-library/**

# Example: Include composer.json for plugin that needs it at runtime
# !composer.json

# Example: Include specific README for distribution
# !README.txt

# Example: Include only production assets from src/
# assets/src/
# !assets/src/dist/
# !assets/src/dist/**

# Notes:
# - Exclusion patterns are IN ADDITION to the default exclusions
# - Inclusion patterns (!) can override BOTH default and custom exclusions
# - The .buildignore file itself is automatically excluded
# - Default exclusions include: .git, node_modules, vendor, tests, etc.
# - Inclusions must come with proper wildcards for directories (use trailing ** for contents)
# - Be careful with negations - rsync processes rules in order
